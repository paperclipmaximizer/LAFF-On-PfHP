# LAFF-On-PfHP
Repository for my "LAFF-On Programming for High Performance" working dir.










































## ..
This repository holds the exercises related to the Massive Open Online
Course "Programming for High Performance" to be offered on the edX
platform.

Most of the materials can already be accessed by visiting
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/laff/pfhp/LAFF-On-PfHP.html.
That PreTeXt generated book will eventually be distributed via
http://ulaff.net.
